# Page Selector

A React component that displays a series of pages for selection, reordering, and modification via context menu.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   yarn
   ```
1. Run the development environment
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

## Notes

- Avoided implementing inputs for page type and name when adding a new page as it isn't specified in the Figma file.
