# Page Selector

A React component that displays a series of pages for selection, reordering, and modification via context menu.

## Setup

1. `yarn`
1. `yarn dev`

## Notes

- Avoided implementing inputs for page type and name when adding a new page as it isn't specified in the Figma file.
- Used several hardcoded Tailwind values to exactly match the Figma file colors without worrying too much about a theme.
